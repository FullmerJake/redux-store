  ## Installation
  All you have to do to install the files is copy this repo onto your computer. Once you've done that, make sure all the dependancies are installed using npm install, and then start the program with the command npm start. It should automatically open the browser at the correct port. 

  ## Usage
  Use this code as the baseline on how to create an e-commerce site using Redux and React. It is indeed a full MERN application, and you can apply whatever you find here onto your own site.
